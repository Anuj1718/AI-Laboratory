# The **graph coloring problem** is a classic problem in graph theory where the goal is to assign colors to the vertices of a graph such that **no two adjacent vertices share the same color**. The main objective is usually to **minimize the number of colors used**.

# ### Formally:

# * Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, assign a color to each vertex $v \in V$.
# * Constraint: For every edge $(u, v) \in E$, the colors of $u$ and $v$ must be different.
# * Goal: Use the **minimum number of colors** (called the **chromatic number** of the graph).

# ### Example:

# If you have a triangle graph (3 vertices, all connected), you need 3 different colors â€” one for each vertex.

# ### Applications:

# * Register allocation in compilers
# * Scheduling problems
# * Map coloring (e.g., coloring regions on a map such that no two adjacent regions have the same color)
# * Frequency assignment in mobile networks
# * Sudoku solving

# * Graph coloring is NP-hard, meaning that no polynomial-time algorithm is known to solve all instances of the problem efficiently.
