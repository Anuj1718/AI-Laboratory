# Updates the total cost of the MST by adding the weight of the edge connecting from_node to current_node.

# In Python, the get() method in a dictionary is used to safely retrieve the value for a given key. Unlike direct access using dict[key], it does not raise a KeyError if the key is not found â€” instead, it returns None or a specified default value.
# The append() method is a list method, not a dictionary method. 
# The list mst_edges stores tuples representing the edges included in the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
