# Implementing BFS
import collections

    visited = set() #
    queue = collections.deque([root]) #queue = [root], this is not an ideal way to implement a queue in python, but it works for this example.  

    while queue: #while queue is not empty
        vertex = queue.popleft() #pop the first element from the queue
        visited.add(vertex) #add the vertex to the visited set 
        for i in graph[vertex]: #for each element in the graph at the vertex
            if i not in visited: #if the element is not in the visited set
                queue.append(i) #append the element to the queue

    print(visited)
